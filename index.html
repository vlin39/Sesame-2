            <h1>Part 1: Sketches and Wireframe</h1>
            <h2>Visualizing our Ideas</h2>
            <p>
                For this project, 4 of us, Allen Dufort, Sofia Guarisma, Kaley Newlin, and Valentina Lin,
                worked in a team to bring a company's idea to life.
                We had the oppertunity to work with the healthcare company <i>Sesame</i> for this project.
                <i>Sesame</i> works to get healthcare to users faster and cheaper while
                retaining high quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our first step in working with <i>Sesame</i> was to understand what problems
                they wanted to tackle with our new design, as well as to brainstorm.
                The main points we has to tackle were:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating personalized and engaging webpages</li>
                <li>Provide the user with enhanced understanding and personalized learning</li>
                <li>
                    Accessibility and clarity, making sure information is easy to understand 
                    and the website is easy to navigate.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p> We then each sketched out what we envisioned the product to be.</p>
            <div className="grid">
                <img src="assets/Allen Sketch.png">
                <img src="assets/Sophia Sketch.png">
                <img src="assets/Kaley Sketch.png">
                <img src="assets/Valentina Sketches.png">
            </div>
            <p> 
                After sketching our ideas, we talked about how we can best tackle the design. 
                We made wireframes integrating our ideas together using a software called <i>Balsamiq</i>.</p>
            <img src="assets/Reference frames.png" style="max-width: 50vw;"></img>
            <p>
                When making design decisions, we wanted to ensure that the usability of the website was high 
                and that patients could customize their healthcare. 
                One component we kept from two of the sketches was a simple <b>Welcome Page</b> 
                to allow users to easily access different features/pages across Sesame’s website. 
                In our opinion, this would allow for users to have greater clarity 
                on what tools were available to them in the interface. 
                Another component that we kept was a <b>Profile Page</b> 
                where users can look at their specific health stats, 
                along with personalized article/educational module recommendations and suggested actions. 
                We believe this decision allows for greater accessibility and patient empowerment, 
                as it makes it easier for users to learn about aspects of their health 
                that they may be concerned about and what they can take into their own hands to address them. 
                Every sketch had some sort of screen that gave users personalized health tips and
                advice, so we combined that into an educational <b>Health Tip Page</b>. 
                This would allow for less overwhelming information, 
                as one page would provide all the information users need 
                about a certain topic, condition, or medication they’re researching. 
                We also decided to create a separate <b>Symptoms Page</b>, found in one of our sketches, 
                so users could ask for consultations based on health symptoms they had.
                We ultimately decided to develop four different web pages: 
                a Welcome Page, a Personal Profile Page, a Symptoms Page, and a Health Tip page. 
                We wanted the users to be able to easily navigate and use the website, 
                while also being able to get specialized care. 
                The designs, specifically the Health Tip page, include features incorporating AI to increase
                accessibility and lessen gaps in healthcare language and knowledge for users.

            <h1>Part 2: Critque and Change</h1>
            <h2>Design Choices and Decision</h2>
            <p>We then met with Vanessa Cho, who is currently the VP in Google Design Platforms.
                She taught us about the several things we can improve in our current design. We also
                got plently of feedback from Ravi Mehta, Sesame's CPO, as well as their Lead Product Designer, Chris
                Chon. </p>
            <p>Some of the made feedback we got was:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our visual hierarchy should "hand-hold" the user. In essence, we should remove unnecessary
                    buttons and tabs from the screen and make it clear what questions each page is asking the user.</li>
                <li>Some buttons on the Educational page and Profile page are the same size as the buttons to the
                    right of the screen, indicating similar importance. The buttons that are less important should be
                    smaller or less prominent.
                </li>
                <li>The button "manual" on the symptoms page is not very telling, and should be modified</li>
                <li>The diagram to click on the body as a way to record pain is a neat aspect.</li>
                <li>The "explain more," "provide examples", and "I'm confused" buttons are very helpful to make the
                    educational page more streamlined</li>
                <li> "Patient Advocacy Tips" and "Suggested Articles" is too eye catching on the profile page.
                    These parts are not as important as "Suggested Actions" and thesefore should be minimized or made
                    less visually prominent.</li>
                <li> On the Welcome Page, which navigational elements should there be and how many should be there?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p> We made edits according to the above feedback.</p>
            <p> On the <b>Welcome Page</b> we decided to decrease the amount of buttons
                a user could chose from, in order to increase usability and conversion rate. Also, we added a "Login"
                button
                to make the personal page accessible from the welcome page.</p>
            <p> Since there were many tabs in the <b>Profile Page</b>, we decided to remove the
                tab on the left ( we did this for the <b>Health Tip Page</b> as well). The "Suggested Articles"
                section was renamed to "Lesson Recommendations" and moved to the bottom of the scrollable page.
                The "Settings" section and the "Patient Advocacy Tips" were switched so that "Patient Advocacy"
                could be higher in the visual hierarchy. These sections were also colored in more faded colors
                in order to detract attention from the sections.</p>
            <p> We made sure to put all relevant information about the given educational connent in the center of the
                screen,
                rather than on the sides of the screen in the tabs in the <b> Health Tip Page</b>. The left tab
                was removed,
                and the right tab was replaced with a table of contents and buttons for actions relevant to the current
                educational connent. </p>
            <p> Since the human anaotmy clicking portion of our <b>Symptoms Page</b> may not be usable when
                describing non-locational pain, we decided to have a first page that asks whether you want to write in
                your
                symptoms or "Click-and-Fill". </p>
        </div>
        <div className="content">
            <h1>Part 3: Hi-Fi Prototype</h1>
            <h2>Visualizing the final product</h2>
            <p>We proceeded to make a <a
                    href="https://www.figma.com/design/pmCoqHV0DlMLePvZ8nJowJ/Sesame-2---9-Hi-Fi-Prototype?node-id=0-1&t=o9kGvM6ZUfJXHLmx-1">High
                    Fidelity Mockup </a> via Figma.
                we were able to meet with Ravi and Chris a couple mroe times, where we learned a lot about accessibility
                and user-oritented design. In the future, some changes we would like to make include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The scale on desktop could be reduced, also with consideration of phone usage.</li>
                <li>More functionalities cna be included under the fold of the scroll. </li>
                <li>For the symptoms page, we want to make sure that we really "hand-hold" the user.
                    We should change the first page to ask if the pain is localized rather than using terms taht the
                    user may not understand or
                    have a conceptualization of. Also, we may want to change the Symptoms Page into multiple one
                    question windows. Ravi and Chris
                    found that their conversion rate had increased by 40% when they did this with their Weight Loss
                    page. It also will be more useful for thsoe with a smaller screen, such as people using a mobile
                    device.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p> This experince provided us with a wonderful insight when it came to workign with designs in the real
                world. Thanks Sesame!</p>
