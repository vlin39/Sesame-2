        <h3>Visualizing our Ideas</h3>
        <p>
            For this project, 4 of us, Allen Dufort, Sofia Guarisma, Kaley Newlin, and Valentina Lin,
            worked in a team to bring a company's idea to life.
            We had the opportunity to work with the healthcare company <i>Sesame</i> for this project.
            <i>Sesame</i> works to get healthcare to users faster and cheaper while
            retaining high quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our first step in working with <i>Sesame</i> was to understand what problems
            they wanted to tackle with our new design, as well as to brainstorm.
            The main points we had to tackle were:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating personalized and engaging webpages</li>
            <li>Provide the user with enhanced understanding and personalized learning</li>
            <li>
                Accessibility and clarity, making sure information is easy to understand
                and the website is easy to navigate.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We then each sketched out what we envisioned the product to be.</p>

        <p>
            After sketching our ideas, we discussed how to best incorporate the different aspects of our design.s
            We then made a mockup design integrating our ideas together, using a software called <i>Balsamiq</i>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container mx-auto row">
        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center mb-4">

        <p>
            When making design decisions, we wanted to ensure that the usability of the website was high
            and that patients could customize their healthcare.
        </p>
        <p>
            One component we kept from two of the sketches was a simple <b>Welcome Page</b>
            to allow users to easily access different features/pages across Sesame's website.
            In our opinion, this would allow for users to have greater clarity
            on what tools were available to them in the interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another component that we kept was a <b>Profile Page</b>
            where users can look at their specific health stats,
            along with personalized article/educational module recommendations and suggested actions.
            We believe this decision allows for greater accessibility and patient empowerment,
            as it makes it easier for users to learn about aspects of their health
            they find concerning and what they can do to address these concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every sketch had some kind of screen that gave users personalized health tips and
            advice, so we combined that into an educational <b>Health Tip Page</b>.
            This would allow for less overwhelming information,
            as one page would provide all the information users need
            about a certain topic, condition, or medication they're researching.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also decided to create a separate <b>Symptoms Page</b>, found in one of our sketches,
            so users could ask for consultations based on health symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
            We ultimately decided to develop four different web pages:
            a Welcome Page, a Personal Profile Page, a Symptoms Page, and a Health Tip page.
            We wanted the users to be able to easily navigate and use the website,
            while also being able to get specialized care.
            The designs, specifically the Health Tip page, include features incorporating AI to increase
            accessibility and lessen gaps in healthcare language and knowledge for users.

      <h2>Part 2: Critques and Changes</h2>
      <h3>Design Choices and Decision</h3>
      <p>
        We then met with Vanessa Cho, the current Vice President of Google
        Design Platforms. She gave us several suggestions on what to focus on
        and possible improvements to our design. We also got plenty of feedback
        from Ravi Mehta, Sesame's CPO, as well as their Lead Product Designer,
        Chris Chon.
      </p>
      <p>Some of the main feedback we got was:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Our visual hierarchy should "hand-hold" the user. In essence, we
          should remove unnecessary components from the screen and clarify what
          questions each page is asking the user.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some buttons on the Educational page and Profile page are the same
          size as the buttons to the right of the screen, indicating similar
          importance. The less important buttons should be smaller or less
          prominent.
        </li>
        <li>
          The button "manual" on the symptoms page is not very telling and
          should be modified
        </li>
        <li>
          The diagram to click on the body as a way to record pain is a neat
          aspect.
        </li>
        <li>
          The "Explain More," "Provide Examples", and "I'm Confused" buttons are
          very helpful to make the educational page more streamlined
        </li>
        <li>
          "Patient Advocacy Tips" and "Suggested Articles" are too prominent on
          the profile page. These parts are not as important as "Suggested
          Actions" and therefore should be minimized or made less visually
          prominent.
        </li>
        <li>
          On the Welcome Page, which navigational elements should there be, and
          how many should be there?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We made edits according to the above feedback.</p>
      <p>
        On the <b>Welcome Page</b> we decided to decrease the number of buttons
        a user could choose from, in order to increase usability and conversion
        rate. Also, we added a "Login" button to make the personal page
        accessible from the welcome page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since there were many tabs in the <b>Profile Page</b>, we decided to
        remove the tab on the left ( we did this for the
        <b>Health Tip Page</b> as well). The "Suggested Articles" section was
        renamed to "Lesson Recommendations" and moved to the bottom of the
        scrollable page. The "Settings" section and the "Patient Advocacy Tips"
        were switched so that "Patient Advocacy" could be higher in the visual
        hierarchy. These sections were also colored in more faded colors to
        detract attention from the sections.
      </p>
      <p>
        We made sure to put all relevant information about the given educational
        content in the center of the screen, rather than on the sides of the
        screen in the tabs in the <b> Health Tip Page</b>. The left tab was
        removed, and the right tab was replaced with a table of contents and
        buttons for actions relevant to the current educational content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the human anatomy clicking portion of our <b>Symptoms Page</b> may
        not be usable when describing non-locational pain, we decided to have a
        first-page that asks whether you want to write in your symptoms or
        "Click-and-Fill".
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container mx-auto" id="prototype">
        <h2>Part 3: Hi-Fi Prototype</h2>
        <h3>Visualizing the final product</h3>
        <p>
            We proceeded to make a
            <a
                href="https://www.figma.com/design/pmCoqHV0DlMLePvZ8nJowJ/Sesame-2---9-Hi-Fi-Prototype?node-id=0-1&t=o9kGvM6ZUfJXHLmx-1">
                High Fidelity Mockup
            </a>
            via Figma.
            We were able to meet with Ravi and Chris a couple more times, where we learned a lot about accessibility
            and user-oriented design.
            In the future, some changes we would like to make include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The scale on desktop devices could be reduced, also with consideration of phone usage.</li>
            <li>More functionalities can be included under the fold of the scroll. </li>
            <li>
                For the symptoms page, we want to make sure that we really "hand-hold" the user.
                We should change the first page to ask if the pain is localized rather than using terms that the
                user may not understand or have a conceptualization of.
                Also, we may want to change the Symptoms Page into multiple one question windows.
                Ravi and Chris found that their conversion rate had increased by 40%
                when they did this with their Weight Loss page.
                It also will be more useful for those with a smaller screen,
                such as people using a mobile device.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This experience provided us with a wonderful insight when it came to working with designs in the real
            world.
            Thank you Sesame!
