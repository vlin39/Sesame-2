            <h2>Visualizing our Ideas</h2>
            <p> For this project, 4 of us, Allen Dufort, Sofia Guarisma, Kaley Newlin, and Valentina Lin
                worked in a team to bring a company's idea to life.
                We had the oppertunity to work with "Sesame" for this project.
                The company "Sesame" works to get healthcare to users faster and cheaper while
                retaining high quality.
            </p>
            <p> Our first step in working with Sesame was to understand what problems
                they wanted to tackle with our new design, as well as to brainstorm.
                The main points we has to tackle were:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating personalized and engaging webpages</li>
                <li>Provide the user with enhanced understanding and personalized learning</li>
                <li>Accessibility and clarity, making sure information is easy to understand and the website is easy to
                    use.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> We then each sketched out what we envisioned the product to be.</p>
