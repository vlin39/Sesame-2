            <h1>Part 1:<br></br>Sketch and Wireframe</h1>
            <h2>Visualizing our Ideas</h2>
            <p> For this project, 4 of us, Allen Dufort, Sofia Guarisma, Kaley Newlin, and Valentina Lin
                worked in a team to bring a company's idea to life.
                We had the oppertunity to work with "Sesame" for this project.
                The company "Sesame" works to get healthcare to users faster and cheaper while
                retaining high quality.
            </p>
            <p> Our first step in working with Sesame was to understand what problems
                they wanted to tackle with our new design, as well as to brainstorm.
                The main points we has to tackle were:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating personalized and engaging webpages</li>
                <li>Provide the user with enhanced understanding and personalized learning</li>
                <li>Accessibility and clarity, making sure information is easy to understand and the website is easy to
                    use.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> We then each sketched out what we envisioned the product to be.</p>
            <div className="grid">

                <img src="assets/Sophia Sketch.png">

                <img src="assets/Valentina Sketches.png">
            </div>
            <p> After sketching our ideas, we talked about how we can best tackle the design. We made wireframes
                integrating our ideas together using a software called "Balsamiq" </p>

            <p>

                When making design decisions, we wanted to ensure that the usability of the website was high and that
                patients could
                customize their healthcare. One component we kept from two of the sketches was a simple Welcome Page to
                allow users to
                easily access different features/pages across Sesame’s website. In our opinion, this would allow for
                users to have
                greater clarity on what tools were available to them in the interface. Another component that we kept
                was a Profile Page
                where users can look at their specific health stats, along with personalized article/educational module
                recommendations
                and suggested actions. We believe this decision allows for greater accessibility and patient
                empowerment, as it makes it
                easier for users to learn about aspects of their health that they may be concerned about and what they
                can take into
                their own hands to address them. Every sketch had some sort of screen that gave users personalized
                health tips and
                advice, so we combined that into an educational Health Tip Page. This would allow for less overwhelming
                information, as
                one page would provide all the information users need about a certain topic, condition, or medication
                they’re
                researching. We also decided to create a separate Symptoms Page, found in one of our sketches, so users
                could ask for
                consultations based on health symptoms they had.
                <br></br>
                We ultimately decided to develop four different web pages: a Welcome Page, a Personal Profile Page, a
                Symptoms Page, and
                a Health Tip page. We wanted the users to be able to easily navigate and use the website, while also
                being able to get
                specialized care. The designs, specifically the Health Tip page, include features incorporating AI to
                increase
                accessibility and lessen gaps in healthcare language and knowledge for users.
